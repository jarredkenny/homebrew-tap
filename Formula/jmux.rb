# jmux — Homebrew formula
#
# Lives here so it is versioned with the code it installs; release.sh copies the
# bumped copy into the tap repo (jarredkenny/homebrew-tap).
#
# NOTE: this is not a bottle. A bottle is a prebuilt keg Homebrew produces from
# a formula; this pours an upstream binary tarball, which is a formula whose
# `url` happens to be a precompiled archive. `brew install --build-from-source`
# is therefore meaningless here — there is no source build to fall back to.
#
# Every sha256 carries a trailing `# <platform>` comment. release.sh's bumper
# matches on those tags rather than on position, because a formula has several
# identical-looking sha256 lines and pairing one with the wrong architecture
# would install the wrong binary and still pass its own integrity check.

      Teach your agents the jmux control CLI:
        jmux --install-skill

      Install agent state hooks (Claude Code, Codex, pi):
        jmux --install-agent-hooks

      Both write into those tools' own config. To reverse them before
      uninstalling jmux:
        jmux --uninstall-integrations

    # The real risk in a compiled binary is asset materialization. Under
    # `bun build --compile` the bundle lives on a virtual filesystem that tmux —
    # a separate process — cannot read, so jmux must write its tmux config out
    # to a real path before spawning tmux. If that regresses, the binary starts
    # and then fails in a way `--version` would never catch.
    #
    # `--install-skill` drives exactly that path, and needs no tmux, no pty and
    # no writable /tmp, so it is deterministic inside the test sandbox. Booting
    # the full TUI here is not: Homebrew's sandbox stops tmux from starting a
    # server, and the failure looks like jmux's rather than the sandbox's.
